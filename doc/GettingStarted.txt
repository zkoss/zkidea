Getting Started: Your First 5 Minutes

This guide will walk you through the key features to get you productive immediately.

1. Create a New ZK Project in Seconds

  The easiest way to start is with the built-in Maven archetypes.

   * Go to File > New > Project....
   * Choose a ZK Maven Archetype, click Next, and follow the wizard.
   * The plugin will generate a complete, runnable ZK project structure for you.

2. Experience Powerful ZUL Code Completion

  This is the plugin's core feature. Open any .zul file from your projects to see it in action.

   * Component Completion: Start typing <win and the editor will suggest the <window> component. Press Enter to complete it.
   * Attribute Assist: Inside the <window> tag, press Ctrl+Space (or your IDE's shortcut for code completion) to see a list of all available attributes, like title, border, and viewModel.
   * Syntax Validation: Try typing an invalid attribute. The plugin will immediately highlight it as an error, preventing mistakes before you even run the application.

3. Accelerate MVVM Development

  The plugin provides support for the MVVM pattern.

   * In your ZUL file, type @init(' inside a component. The plugin will suggest available ViewModel classes from your project.
   * Once your ViewModel is bound, type @load(vm. and you will get code completion for the properties and methods available on your ViewModel class.

4. Edit Configuration Files with Confidence

  Stop guessing at tag names in your configuration files.

   * Open zk.xml or lang-addon.xml.
   * You get the same powerful, schema-aware code completion and validation that you have in your ZUL files.
      > Note: For code completion to work on custom-named XML files, you must add the correct namespace (e.g., xmlns="http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zk/config").
